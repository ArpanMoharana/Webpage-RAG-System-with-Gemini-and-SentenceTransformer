Three days later, the model will make its public debut at the Icons of Porsche Festival in Dubai, giving international media and fans a first look on November 22–23.\\nThe Cayenne Electric is positioned as the third powertrain variant of the model line, adding a fully electric option alongside combustion and plug-in hybrid versions. Porsche says the new SUV is based on its latest electric vehicle architecture and aims to set benchmarks in performance, charging capability, comfort, and digital connectivity. The company frames the car as the next chapter in a story that began in 2002, when Cayenne broadened the brand’s reach with a mix of performance, versatility, and everyday practicality.\\nThe world premiere will stream via the Porsche Newsroom as well as the company’s YouTube and LinkedIn channels, with the program available on demand afterward. At the Dubai festival, which last year drew an estimated 28,000 visitors, attendees will be able to experience the Cayenne Electric up close for the first time.\\nTagged With: Cayenne Electric, EV\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n Share on Facebook\\n\\n\\n\\n Share\\n Share\\n Pin It\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Previous Post\\nVanier earns Porsche Junior Shootout nod after strong 2025 season\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNever Miss Another Update, Review, or Giveaway\\nSubscribe to the first and only source of original Porsche-related content.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCheck Out These Other Porsche Blog Posts[jetpack-related-posts]OUR VALUED SPONSORS\\n..\\nLooking for Something?\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nThe best car waxes to keep your Porsche smooth and shinyThe best pressure washers for washing your carThe best foam cannons to help keep your Porsche clean (2025)The best interior cleaners to keep your Porsche’s cabin freshThe best quick detailers to keep your car clean in between washes\\n \\nBack to top \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tCopyright © Flatsixes.com 2025 · All Rights Reserved\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n \\n\\nShare this post\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')]"
